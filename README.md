# SaSSEase - A Mixins Lab

A hand-picked collection of useful SAAS Mixins for most of the usual styling tasks. The collection holds various mixins from multiple articles online, stackoverflow and written by me.

## List of Mixins
* [Box](https://codepen.io/tusharshukla/pen/MqxaKZ) - Create a box by providing width and height as parameters. If height is not provided, width is taken as default for height and the box becomes a square.
```
@include box(100px);
@include box(200px, 100px);
```
* [Mixin 2](http://www..google.com) - Test mixin with descripion here
```
Example of Mixin 2
```

## Important
All of the mixins are tried and tested hence they should serve their exact purpose.
All the mixins are well documented so as to make them very easy to understand and use

Continuous additions/improvements of mixins are happening in this repository so keep a watch :)
